Road Map
Here is what I would change before deploying this code:
* Currently the carousel and image grid only support 1 carousel/image grid per page - it would be nice to improve the logic in config.rb to be able to include multiple carousels/image grids on a page.
* I've tested on Chrome and Firefox. If I was deploying this to production I would use browser stack to test on IE/Edge and on the iOS and Android mobile browsers.
* It would be nice to use the picture element or media queries to load smaller images on mobile devices.
* Add captions and alt tags to the images to improve accessibility and SEO.
* Add unit test for the new methods in config.rb
